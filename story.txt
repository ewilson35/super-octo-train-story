The wizard Mark lived in England in 1562.
He wandered the London streets at night, listening for thieves.
He wanted to catch such thieves and cast his spells on them to protect the citizens of London.

After a couple hours of quiet, the first sign of thievery occured. A storefront window across the street had been shattered and shadowy figures crept inside. With his knowledge of protective spells, Mark cast a shield enompassing the entire store, locking the criminals inside. He then channeled his potent powers and triggered a slow seepage of noxious magic through the air that would wipe out the criminals in a matter of seconds by rotting them from the inside out.

Evil had been thwarted, but Mark remained suspicious. That was almost too
easy. It was unusual that the thieves stayed within the store that long
after the glass had been shattered. It wasn't long until Mark's suspicion
became a reality. It turned out this petty thievery was merely a distraction.
Moments later, a massive heist at the Bank of England was
reported. A larger gang of thieves had taken the bank's employees and a group
of patrons hostage within the bank. Mark quickly rushed to the scene of the 
crime, where police surrounded the building. Mark prepared himself to cast
a destruction spell. However, he then remembered the hostages inside. He
couldn't just vanquish the thieves without risk of injuring the hostages. 
What would Mark do next?
