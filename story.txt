The wizard Mark lived in England in 1562.
He wandered the London streets at night, listening for thieves.
He wanted to catch such thieves and cast his spells on them to protect the citizens of London.

After a couple hours of quiet, the first sign of thievery occured. A storefront window across the street had been shattered and shadowy figures crept inside. With his knowledge of protective spells, Mark cast a shield enompassing the entire store, locking the criminals inside. He then channeled his potent powers and triggered a slow seepage of noxious magic through the air that would wipe out the criminals in a matter of seconds by rotting them from the inside out.
